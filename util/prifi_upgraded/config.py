If both P.fw and Q.fw are similar and P.rv and Q.rv are similar, and Q has a higher score than P, then P is not reported (since it is considered to be more or less the same set as Q). Furthermore, if some primer p is similar to two other primers already reported, p (i.e., any set that includes p) is not reported (note that such sets would have lower scores than the sets already reported). Thus, the primer sets eventually reported are the highest scoring sets under these restrictions.
